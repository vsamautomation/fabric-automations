        "## Overview\n",
        "This enhanced notebook provides comprehensive functions for analyzing semantic models to identify unused objects (measures, columns, and tables) that can be removed to optimize model performance and reduce complexity.\n",
        "\n",
        "## âœ¨ New Features Added\n",
        "- **ðŸŽ¯ Integrated Unused Objects Detection**: Automatically detects unused measures, columns, and tables after collecting workspace objects\n",
        "- **ðŸ“Š Enhanced Visualization**: Comprehensive 4-panel visualization showing usage metrics for all object types\n",
        "- **ðŸ’¾ Lakehouse Storage**: Saves unused objects analysis results to dedicated lakehouse tables\n",
        "- **ðŸ“ˆ Real-time Progress Tracking**: Enhanced progress tracker showing unused objects analysis status\n",
        "\n",
        "## Key Features\n",
        "- **Unused Measures Detection**: Identifies measures not referenced in calculations or reports\n",
        "- **Unused Columns Detection**: Finds columns not used in calculations or visualizations\n",
        "- **Unused Tables Detection**: Locates tables with no references in the model\n",
